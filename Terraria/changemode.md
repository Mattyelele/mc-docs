# Change Mode

To change the difficulty/mode, firstly stop your server. Then locate and open the `terraria.properties` file found in the files tab and look for `#difficulty=1`. You will have to enable that option by removing the hashtag (#). Then change the number to whatever you like.

Difficulty options: `0`(normal), `1`(expert), `2`(master), `3`(journey)
More info here: https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Server#Server_config_file

You must also at the same time create a new world otherwise the difficulty will not apply. This means you will have to change the ‘worldname’ setting to something new, such as ‘world2’. Please only use letters, numbers and underscores ‘_’ to name your world. Spaces are not allowed.

There is a way to change the difficulty for your current world, however it is only possible via 3rd party software. Unfortunately, we are not able to help with that, but we can provide you a link where you can find out how to do it.

Follow the instructions found on this post:

You might have to download the world files to your PC and re-upload them to the server files later. Please stop the server before downloading your world.
