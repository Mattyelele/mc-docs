# 1.4.0.5 Issue

Unfortunately, this latest Terraria release has some installation issues, as you've noticed already, so in order to get your server working on this latest version you will need to follow all the correct configuration steps in your server console.

If you already have a world created, skip to the second set of instructions.

Please go to your console tab and follow these instructions for creating a world, since you don't have one available:

1. Press `n` and then Enter to create a new world;
2. Choose the size of your world - `1` (Small), `2` (Medium), `3` (Large);
3. Choose the mode - `1` (Classic), `2` (Expert), `3` (Master), `4` (Journey);
4. Type a world name for your world and then press Enter;
5. Add a custom seed or simply press space and Enter;

Now a World will be generated in your server. This can take some time if it’s a large world. Once that is done, the next step is to configure the remaining settings to boot your server:

1. Press `1` to choose the world that you've created and press Enter;
2. Type `16` as the number of players allowed to join the server and press Enter;
3. Finally, type your server Port (which are the numbers that come after the `:` in your server IP) and press Enter;
4. Next simply input `n` and then Enter;
5. Lastly enter in a password and then Enter. You cannot have a server without a password unfortunately because of the limitation of our control panel.
6. IF you’d like to remove the password, simply type ‘password‘. Only do this once the server finishes loading. Don’t forget the space after the ‘password’ as this disables the password.
