# How to install addons
Just a quick summary of what you'll need to do:

-   Download your world
-   Use it in your game locally
-   Apply any addons you want
-   Upload the world
-   Set the value of texturepack-required to true

There is a more detailed explanation of how to do so on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/ProfessorValko/comments/9f438p/bedrock_dedicated_server_tutorial/).

## Upload your world

Be sure the server is turned off for this process. 

Firstly, go to your File Manager and then choose Upload in the top right corner. Select your world on your computer and upload it. If the world is zipped/compressed you need to unpack it first. To unpack the packed world file, select the file in the file manager on your control panel (the text will become blue once the file is selected). To the upper right, you will see an unpack button appear upon selecting the file.

Once the world is unpacked, you can either set the world from the server.properties file or from the Worlds tab on the control panel.

## Download your world

1.  Open your control panel
2.  Go to Files
3.  Click on the folder with the name of your world, usually this folder is called "world" if you haven't changed it or added any new worlds.
4.  After you have marked the folder, click on the button "Download" in the File Manager menu.
5.  The world will now download to your computer as a .tar file and can be opened with programs such as WinRAR or 7zip. (This can take a while depending on the size of your world)
