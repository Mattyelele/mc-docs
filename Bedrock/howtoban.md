# How do I ban a user

As you can see from the table in this [article](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#List_and_summary_of_commands), banning has not yet been implemented for Bedrock Edition servers.

I would instead recommend enabling the whitelist for your server, which can be done by setting the value of the white-list property in your server.properties file to true. This will only allow players that have been added to the whitelist to join the server.
