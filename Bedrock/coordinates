# How to enable coordinates

To do this, you will first have to enable cheats. To enable them you will have to open the server file with the name of `server.properties`. You can open that file with notepad or the server editor.

Then find the option `allow-cheats=false` and change it to `allow-cheats=true`. Then save the file and restart the server.

Once you have done that, please make sure you are OP, then run the command `gamerule showcoordinates true`either from your server console or in-game.
