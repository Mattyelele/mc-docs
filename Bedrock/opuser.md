# How to make a user OP/Admin


In order to run commands/enable cheats on your server you first need to be an Operator (OP) on your server. 

To do this go to the Players tab and select Operators. Then enter your username (ensure capitalization is correct) and press add.

If the above doesn’t work for whatever reason, go to the Console tab and type in “op username”, replacing ‘username’ with your own Minecraft username.

Please note if you're using Bedrock and want to enable cheats as well, go to the File Manager and find the server.properties file. Open it and change the value allow-cheats=false to true.

Note that you shouldn't give OP status to anyone you don't trust.
