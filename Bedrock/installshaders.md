# Install shaders on Bedrock Edition

Installing Shaders is client-side rather than server-side. Therefore, you will need to add it into your 'Global Resources' on your bedrock launcher. 

If you have downloaded the shaders, it should be a 'mcpack'. Once you have downloaded it, double click the file wherever it is located. Minecraft should open itself and import the target shader pack, while it is importing you can see the "Import Started" message, once it's done you should see the success message. 

Then on your Minecraft settings page head to "Global Resources" and then expand the tab that says "My Packs" and click the "Activate" button under the shader pack. Once you have done this it should activate and move to the top of the list. 

You should be able to log into your world and see the installed shader pack in action.
