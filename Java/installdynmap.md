# How to install DynMap

**Make sure that your server is turned off before continuing!**

1. First of all you must head over to the the spigot website and locate the DynMap plugin to download it ([here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/)).
2. Start the server once again, so DynMap can create the folder and configuration files. 
3. Head over to your dashboard and advanced settings to see your open ports. (Premium Servers have 11582 and 21582 port open. PRO servers have between 1024 and 65535), it's your own decision which one you use for DynMap.
4. Then head over to your `configuration.txt` located inside the DynMap folder in side the plugins folder.
5. Inside this file, change the `webserver-bindaddress` to your current server numerical IP and the port that is open to you, for example 11582 (for premium). 
6. Remember to click 'Save File' once you have finished editing the file.
7. Restart your server.
8. If you have done it correctly you should see the following in your console when DynMap is loading:

9. This means that the website to open the map would be the IP:11582. By simply opening this in your browser it should work. 
10.  Have fun!
