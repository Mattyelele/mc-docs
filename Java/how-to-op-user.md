# How to set a player as an operator (OP/Admin)

You can assign OP players through the console or through in-game commands (If the other player is already OP-ed). 

## Assigning OP via Console/Command

By using `/op` you can assign or remove players as OP.

`/op <username>` - Adds a player as an Operator
`/deop <username>` - Removes a player as an Operator

When operating someone through console, make sure you remove the `/`, otherwise it will not work. You do not need `/` when doing commands through console.
