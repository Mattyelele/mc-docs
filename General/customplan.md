# Custom Plans

At this moment in time, the only custom plan we offer is:

**$120/month**
- 16GB Ram
- 5 vCores
- 240GB SSD space

If you wish to upgrade a server to this plan, we will have to do it manually. If you wish to proceed with this, make sure you have enough balance in your account to upgrade from a $40 plan to a $120 plan. This cost is $80 max proportionate to the time remaining in your billing cycle. For example, if there is half a month left in your billing cycle, ensure you have $40 balance and we can upgrade your plan for you.

Please contact our [support team](https://server.pro/contact) to go ahead with this custom plan.
